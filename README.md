# Customer Segmentation with clustering

Update Sep 2021 1st iteration in R: This is a demo customer segmentation model, an extension project from a customer credit evaluation and 
control system Iâ€™ve worked on previously at work. This project is an exploration model to search for 
previously unknown insights/ customer groupings for later customer segmentation modeling. 

It has two components: customer purchasing pattern clustering and location clustering. At the end I ran a combination of 
the two models, which looking back should be taken out. It'd be better to do spatial clustering on its own.

Update May 2022 2nd iteration in Python: This time I've done a kmodes clustering based on customer characteristics: line of business, 
market reach, purchasing frequency, and most frequently purchased product category.
