# Customer Segmentation with R (clustering)
This is a demo customer segmentation model, an extension project from a customer credit evaluation and 
control system Iâ€™ve worked on previously at work. This project is an exploration model to search for 
previously unknown insights/ customer groupings for later customer segmentation modeling.
